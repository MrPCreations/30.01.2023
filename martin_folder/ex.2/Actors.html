          <p>
            Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984 in
            Manhattan, New York City, New York. Her mother, Melanie Sloan is
            from a Jewish family from the Bronx and her father, Karsten
            Johansson is a Danish-born architect from Copenhagen. She has a
            sister, Vanessa Johansson, who is also an actress, a brother,
            Adrian, a twin brother, Hunter Johansson, born three minutes after
            her, and a paternal half-brother, Christian. Her grandfather was
            writer Ejner Johansson. Johansson began acting during childhood,
            after her mother started taking her to auditions. She made her
            professional acting debut at the age of eight in the off-Broadway
            production of "Sophistry" with Ethan Hawke, at New York's
            Playwrights Horizons. She would audition for commercials but took
            rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts. She
            made her film debut at the age of nine, as John Ritter's character's
            daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). Following minor roles
            in Just Cause (1995), as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate
            Capshaw's character, and If Lucy Fell (1996), she played the role of
            Amanda in Manny & Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny & Lo garnered
            a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female,
            and positive reviews, one noting, "[the film] grows on you, largely
            because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson", while San Francisco
            Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated on her "peaceful aura",
            and wrote, "If she can get through puberty with that aura
            undisturbed, she could become an important actress." After appearing
            in minor roles in Fall (1997) and Home Alone 3 (1997), Johansson
            garnered widely spread attention for her performance in The Horse
            Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford, where she played Grace
            MacLean, a teenager traumatized by a riding accident. She received a
            nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most
            Promising Actress for the film. In 1999, she appeared in My Brother
            the Pig (1999) and in the music video for Mandy Moore's single,
            "Candy". Although the film was not a box office success, she
            received praise for her breakout role in Ghost World (2001),
            credited with "sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age". She was
            also featured in the Coen Brothers' dark drama The Man Who Wasn't
            There (2001), opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Frances McDormand. She
            appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002) with David
            Arquette and Kari Wuhrer. In 2003, she was nominated for two Golden
            Globe Awards, one for drama (Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003)) and
            one for comedy (Lost in Translation (2003)), her breakout role,
            starring opposite Bill Murray, and receiving rave reviews and a Best
            Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival. Her film roles include
            the critically acclaimed Weitz brothers' film In Good Company
            (2004), as well as starring opposite John Travolta in A Love Song
            for Bobby Long (2004), which garnered her a third Golden Globe Award
            nomination. She dropped out of Mission: Impossible III (2006) due to
            scheduling conflicts. Her next film role was in The Island (2005)
            alongside Ewan McGregor which earned weak reviews from U.S. critics.
            After this, she appeared in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005) and was
            nominated again for a Golden Globe Award. In May 2008, she released
            her album "Anywhere I Lay My Head", a collection of Tom Waits covers
            featuring one original song. Also that year, she starred in Frank
            Miller's The Spirit (2008), the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina
            Barcelona (2008), and played Mary Boleyn opposite Natalie Portman in
            The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Since then, she has appeared as part
            of an ensemble cast in the romantic comedy He's Just Not That Into
            You (2009), the action superhero film Iron Man 2 (2010), the
            comedy-drama We Bought a Zoo (2011) and starred as the original
            scream queen, Janet Leigh, in Hitchcock (2012). She then played her
            character, Black Widow, in the blockbuster action films The Avengers
            (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of
            Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity
            War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) and Black Widow (2021), and
            also headlined the sci-fi action thriller Lucy (2014), a box office
            success. With more than a decade of work already under her belt,
            Scarlett has proven to be one of Hollywood's most talented young
            actresses. Her other starring roles are in the sci-fi action
            thriller Ghost in the Shell (2017) and the dark comedy Rough Night
            (2017). Scarlett and Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds were engaged in
            May 2008 and married in September of that year. In 2010, the couple
            announced their separation, and subsequently divorced a year later.
            In 2013, she became engaged to French journalist Romain Dauriac, the
            couple married a year later. In January 2017, the couple announced
            their separation, and subsequently divorced in March of that year.
            They have a daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac (born 2014)

          <h1>Javier Bardem</h1>
          <br />
          <br /><img
            src="img/Javier_Bardem.jpg"
            alt="Javier Bardem"
            class="mx-auto"
          /><br />
          <p>
            Javier Bardem belongs to a family of actors that have been working
            on films since the early days of Spanish cinema. He was born in Las
            Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, to actress Pilar Bardem (María del
            Pilar Bardem Muñoz) and businessman José Carlos Encinas Doussinague.
            His maternal grandparents were actors Rafael Bardem and Matilde
            Muñoz Sampedro, and his uncle is screenwriter Juan Antonio Bardem.
            He got his start in the family business, at age six, when he
            appeared in his first feature, "El picaro" (1974) (A.K.A. The
            Scoundrel). During his teenage years, he acted in several TV series,
            played rugby for the Spanish National Team, and toured the country
            with an independent theatrical group. Javier's early film role as a
            sexy stud in the black comedy, Jamón, Jamón (1992) (aka Ham Ham)
            propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him
            as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a
            beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on
            to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from
            film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his
            belt, it is Javier's stirring, passionate performance as the
            persecuted Cuban writer, Reynaldo Arenas, in Before Night Falls
            (2000) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role. He
            received five Best Actor awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination
            for his portrayal.
